In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style
of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats
computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing
state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means
programming is done with expressions or declarations[2] instead of statements.
In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments
that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same
value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time. Eliminating
side effects, i.e. changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs,
can make it much easier to understand and predict the behaviour of a program,
which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional
programming.
